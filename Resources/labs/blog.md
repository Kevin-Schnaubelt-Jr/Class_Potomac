## Lab Exercise: Designing a Fake Blog Post

### **Objective**:
Your task is to build a webpage for a simple fake blog post, using your understanding of HTML, CSS, and especially flexbox.

### **Requirements**:

1. Your webpage should represent a fake blog post.
2. This blog post must include the following elements:
   - Title of the blog.
   - Name of the author.
   - Publication date.
   - Content, consisting of 2-3 paragraphs.
   - A related image (You can use any placeholder image from the web).

### **Instructions**:

1. **Setup**:
   - Create a folder called `blogpost`
   - Create a new HTML file inside your `blogpost` folder and name it `index.html`.
   - Create a new CSS file there as well and name it `styles.css`.
   - Link your CSS file inside the HTML.

2. **HTML Structure**:
   - Use appropriate tags to structure your blog post, making sure you include all the required elements.
   - Some helpful tags are `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<div>`, and `<footer>`.

3. **Flexbox Layout**:
   - Don't forget to use Flexbox to format your elements. Think about how best to present these - should they be evenly spaced? Grouped together?

4. **Styling**:
   - Think of a color scheme for your blog post. You might find tools like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) helpful for this.
   - Make sure your title stands out! This is what draws readers in.
   - The author's name and the date should be styled in a way that provides this information without distracting from the title.
   - Make sure your content is easy to read. Think about font size, line height, and paragraph spacing.
   - Your image should be integrated neatly with your post. Ensure it doesn't appear too large or too small, and consider any necessary margins.

5. **Challenge**:
   - If you finish early, think about how you might make your blog post design responsive (how it looks when the user resizes the screen). You can use media queries to do this. `@media (max-width: 600px) { ... }` will apply the styles inside the brackets when the screen is 600px or less. You can also use `min-width` to apply styles when the screen is larger than a certain size.

### **Tips**:
- Remember, this is your design, so feel free to get creative! Just ensure you're meeting all the requirements.
- If you're unsure about any flexbox properties or need a refresher, consider revisiting class notes or using online resources such as [CSS-Tricks' Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

### **Submission**:
Be prepared to explain your design choices and how you implemented the flexbox layout.
